# Task 4 ‚Äì Firewall Configuration (Windows)

This project focuses on configuring a Windows Firewall rule to block Telnet traffic (port 23) using the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security GUI. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with firewall rule creation, network traffic filtering, and improving system security by disabling an outdated and insecure protocol.

## üîê Objective
To configure Windows Firewall to block Telnet traffic (port 23) and gain practical experience with basic firewall rule management.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security (GUI)

## ‚úÖ Actions Performed
